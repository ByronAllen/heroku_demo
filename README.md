# Heroku Demo | Deploying a Twitter Bot

##### Description 

In mid-2016 I built at Twitter bot, @findmyatm, which taught me the fundamentals of deploying a web-based application and running it continuously on a remote server. 

I want to share that knowledge, so I developed this repository to assist anyone looking to quickly learn how to remotely deploy a non-graphical program such as a Twitter bot. 

##### Directions (under construction)

* Sign up to Herkou's free-tier https://signup.heroku.com/dc
* Create a new Twitter account or be ready to use your current account
* Create a Twitter 'app' to obtain Twitter API authentication keys https://apps.twitter.com/
* Clone this repository, update the keyz.py file with Twitter API authentication keys and rename the file keys.py
* Reference Heroku's 'Getting Started on Heroku with Python' https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction
